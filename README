chBackupGenerator is oriented to functionnal with a Debian GNU/Linux. In fact, the purpose of this tools, is that you can deploy a lot of backup script easily.

To the client : ch-sauvegarde-file, ch-sauvegarde-mysql, are directory to Debian archive.

ch-sauvegarde-file allow to generate 2 scripts : save_complete and save_differentielle. They will use the rsync command to contact via ssh a server that you will define in the postinst.
ch-sauvegarde-mysql allow to generate 1 script which will dump mysql database with the mysqldump command.

To the server : check_nsca, and tarization.

check_nsca : allow to send an nsca alert to nagios. You must have installed the nsca package (with aptitude for example)
tarization : allow to create a tar of the yesterday backup.
